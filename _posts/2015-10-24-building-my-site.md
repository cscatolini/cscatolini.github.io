Finally, after some months of productive procrastination I decided that time has come for me to create my own website ;)

After a 5-minute google research I thought it might try using [github pages](https://pages.github.com) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

I did so with the help of these two amazing tutorials:

- http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/
- http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/
