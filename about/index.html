  <h2>Hi, again! It is nice to have you here.</h2>
  <p>I am a 23-year-old software engineer and amateur musician. I got my bachelor's degree in electrical engineering at the <a href="http://www5.usp.br/english/?lang=en" target="_blank">University of São Paulo</a> (Brazil) and my <i>diplôme d'ingénieur</i>, more or less equivalent to a master of engineering degree, at <a href="http://www.telecom-paristech.fr/eng/training-innovating-in-a-digital-world.html" target="_blank">Télécom ParisTech</a> (France).</p>
  <p>My main hobby is music. I spend most of my free time playing the electric guitar, fooling around with VSTs and my little MIDI keyboard and trying to record and produce some music in my home studio. Soon I'll add a section with my recordings in here.</p>
  <p>Besides music, I also love studying languages. Portuguese is my mother tongue, but I also speak French, English, basic German and Swedish. I'm currently using <a href='https://www.duolingo.com/camilascatolini' target="_blank">Duolingo</a> for my Swedish studies, but I'd like trying to improve my skills with some more ~traditional~ language courses sometime soon.</p>
  <p>For a year now I have been using a bicycle as my main transportation, i. e., I go to work by bike everyday, what makes about 50 to 60km every week. Well, moving around in São Paulo is kind of crazy, so I figured I'd better find a way to make my journey to work pleasurable.</p>
  <p>I hope you enjoy your time here. Feel free to contact me by clicking at the icons at the bottom of the page.</p>
